        Thank you for saying yes baby <3. This year there won't be a lot of
        gifts like last one :( but next year I promise you I'll give you the
        best valentines day ever! and I'll spend every day of the rest of my
        life showing you just how important you are to me. I'm happy I get to
        spend another Febuary with you.
